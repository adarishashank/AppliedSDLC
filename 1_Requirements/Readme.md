# Requirements
## Introduction
Airline Reservation System(ARS) is one of the basic essentials in the sector of Aviation. ARS are the application which are part of Passenger services where the application supports the customers by enabling ticketing services to them at their convinience rather that spending lots of time by standing in queue in order to book a ticket.
Airline reservation systems incorporate airline schedules, fare tariffs, passenger reservations and ticket records. An airline's direct distribution works within their own reservation system, as well as pushing out information to the GDS(Global Distribution System).
